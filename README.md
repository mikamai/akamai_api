# AkamaiApi

AkamaiApi is a ruby library and command line utility to interact with Akamai CCU (Content Control Utility) and ECCU (Enhanced Content Control Utility) services.

# Using the CLI

After gem installation you will have a CLI utility to execute operations on Akamai. Each method requires authentication. You can provide auth info using one of the following methods:

- Passing --username (-u) and --password (-p) arguments at each invocation
- Set ENV variables: AKAMAI_USERNAME and AKAMAI_PASSWORD
- Creating a config file in your HOME directory named .akamai_api.yml with the following format:

```yaml
    auth:
      - user
      - pass
```

## Tasks

When using the CLI you can work with both CCU and ECCU.

```
    akamai_api ccu          # CCU Interface
    akamai_api eccu         # ECCU Interface
    akamai_api help [TASK]  # Describe available tasks or one specific task
```
Use *akamai_api help* to view the help of the CLI.

## CCU

In the CCU interface you can work with CP Codes and ARLs.

```
    akamai_api ccu cpcode          # CP Code CCU actions
    akamai_api ccu help [COMMAND]  # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
    akamai_api ccu arl             # ARL CCU actions
```

### CP Code

```
    akamai_api ccu cpcode help [COMMAND]                  # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
    akamai_api ccu cpcode invalidate CPCODE1 CPCODE2 ...  # Purge CP Code(s) marking their cache as expired
    akamai_api ccu cpcode list                            # Print the list of CP Codes
    akamai_api ccu cpcode remove CPCODE1 CPCODE2 ...      # Purge CP Code(s) removing them from the cache
```

When removing or invalidating a CP Code you can provide the following optional arguments:

- *--domain*, *-d*: Specify if you want to work with *production* or *staging*. This is a completely optional argument and usually you don't need to set it.
- *--emails*, *-e*: Specify the list of email used by Akamai to send notifications about the purge request.

### ARL

```
  akamai_api ccu arl help [COMMAND]                                                   # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
  akamai_api ccu arl invalidate http://john.com/a.txt http://www.smith.com/b.txt ...  # Purge ARL(s) marking their cache as expired
  akamai_api ccu arl remove http://john.com/a.txt http://www.smith.com/b.txt ...      # Purge ARL(s) removing them from the cache
```

When removing or invalidating an ARL you can provide the following optional arguments:

- *--domain*, *-d*: Specify if you want to work with *production* or *staging*. This is a completely optional argument and usually you don't need to set it.
- *--emails*, *-e*: Specify the list of email used by Akamai to send notifications about the purge request.

## ECCU

In the ECCU interface you can see the requestes already published and publish your own requests.

```
    akamai_api eccu help [COMMAND]                           # Describe subcommands or one specific subcommand
    akamai_api eccu last_request                             # Print the last request made to ECCU
    akamai_api eccu publish_xml path/to/request.xml john.com  # Publish a request made in XML for the specified Digital Property (usually the Host Header)
    akamai_api eccu requests                                 # Print the list of the last requests made to ECCU
```

### Viewing Requests

You can see the requests published on ECCU using *akamai_api eccu requests*
For each request you will see all its details (code, status, etc.) except the file content.
To view the file content add the --content (-c) option.

To see only the last request you can use *akamai_api eccu last_request*.

### Publishing Requests in XML

To publish requests made in XML (ECCU Request Format) you can use *akamai_api eccu publish_xml*.

```
Usage:
  akamai_api publish_xml path/to/request.xml john.com

Options:
  -pt, [--property-type=type]             # Type of enlisted properties
                                          # Default: hostheader
      [--no-exact-match]                  # Do not do an exact match on property names
  -e, [--emails=foo@foo.com bar@bar.com]  # Email(s) to use to send notification on status change
  -n, [--notes=NOTES]
                                          # Default: ECCU Request using AkamaiApi gem
```

The command takes two arguments:
- the file containing the request;
- the Digital Property to which you want to apply the request (usually it's the host);

# As a Library

Remember to init the AkamaiApi gem with your login credentials. You can set your credentials with the following statement:

```ruby
    AkamaiApi.config.merge! :auth => ['user', 'pass']
```

- CpCode: model representing a CP Code. Use the ::all method to retrieve the list of available CpCode.
- Ccu   : CCU interface. Use the ::purge method to purge a list of resources.
- EccuRequest: model representing an ECCU request.

## Ccu

### ::purge

```ruby
    def purge action, type, items, args = {}
      ...
    end
```

- action: symbol or string. It should be *remove* or *invalidate*. See the CLI documentation for more details
- type: symbol or string. It should be *arl* or *cpcode*. Use arl to purge a list of urls, and cpcodes to purge a list of cp codes
- items: the list of the resources to clean
- args: additional options (email, domain)

e.g.

```ruby
    AkamaiApi::Ccu.purge :remove, :arl, ['http://www.foo.com/a.txt'], :email => ['foo@foo.com']
```

### Helpers

```ruby
    ccu = AkamaiApi::Ccu

    ccu.invalidate_cpcode cpcodes # => wrapper to call .purge :invalidate, :cpcode
    ccu.invalidate_arl arls          # => wrapper to call .purge :invalidate, :arl
    ccu.invalidate :arl, arls        # => wrapper to call .purge :invalidate

    ccu.remove_cpcodes cpcodes # => wrapper to call .purge :remove, :cpcode
    ccu.remove_arl arls          # => wrapper to call .purge :remove, :arl
    ccu.remove :arl              # => wrapper to call .purge :remove
```

## EccuRequest

An EccuRequest is an object representing an ECCU Request. To see all the published requests use the ::all method.
To retrieve only the last request, you can use the ::last method.
The following code should be self explaining about both class methods and instance methods:

```ruby
    all_requests_ids = EccuRequest.all_ids                     # => Returns all available requests ids
    first_request    = EccuRequest.find all_requests_ids.first # => Return the EccuRequest model with the specified code

    all_requests = EccuRequest.all  # => Returns all available requests
    last_request = EccuRequest.last # => Return the last available request

    last_request.update_notes! 'My new note' # => Invoke the ECCU service to change the notes field
    last_request.update_email! 'foo@foo.com' # => Invoke the ECCU service to change the email to be notified on status change
    last_request.destroy                     # => Invoke the ECCU service to delete the request
```

Use the ::publish method to publish an ECCU Request:

```ruby
    AkamaiApi::EccuRequest.publish 'example.com', my_content, args
    AkamaiApi::EccuRequest.publish_file 'example.com', 'path/to/file.xml', args
```

You can specify the following optional arguments in args: file_name, notes, version, emails, property_type, property_exact_match
